## Description

This is a backend of a Social Network Application with the focus on the API using MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Mongoose, and Express.js.

A user can use this API to create new users with a valid username and email, add other users as friends, and post "thoughts" and "reactions" (similar to comments and replies). Users can also update and delete thoughts and reactions as well as remove friends.

## Installation

To run this code, simply clone the code, open the cloned code in your favorite IDE, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then run `npm run dev` to start the server and do not forget to check if nodemon is installed.
